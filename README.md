# Booked-And-Busy


## Creation:

The following repo is titled Booked and Busy. I tried to make the repo name something that was unique yet went hand and hand with the function of the webpage. While working on this repo I was given a starter code that helped me to build the rest of the contents around that. I changed items in the index.html and added different style elements and colors to the webpage. I also used JavaScript to add the current time and date and to have the colors of the time-blocks change with past, present, and future color coding. I used helped from my instructor, TA's and classmates to help troubleshoot issues. 

## Contents:

The contents of this repo include the index.html file, an assets folder that holds the JavaScript file and CSS styling sheet. The repo also includes this README.md file that you are currently reading that holds a screenshot of the deployed webpage. 

## Site:

While initially the functions seemed to come together at the very end when I went to deploy the site there seemed to be issues that were causing the attributes and functions to not work as I had planned. As the deadline approaches I am opting to submit and go back to fix the buys. Thank you for your time!
